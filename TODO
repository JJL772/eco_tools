1.	epics-checkout should use our SLAC templates when it creates the bare git repo.

2.	epics-versions should consider makefile ifdef's instead of using a simple grep.
	Possibly leverage off EPICS base checkRelease.pm script

3.	epics-versions could allow a directory to be specified and it would show
	EPICS_BASE, and each module dependency it finds assuming that directory is
	the TOP of an epics package by searching $TOP/configure/RELEASE, etc
	Include an option to show which file the macro was found.
	See my bash function, evers(), for a bash equivalent.
	Add a soft link shortcut named evers pointing to epics-versions.

4.	?
