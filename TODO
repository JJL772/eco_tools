1.	epics-checkout should use our SLAC templates when it creates the bare git repo.

2.	epics-versions should consider makefile ifdef's instead of using a simple grep.
	Possibly leverage off EPICS base checkRelease.pm script.
	Sumo uses makejk
	Update iocAdmin python that creates pv's for module depdendencies to share
	code w/ eco_tools to do proper RELEASE parsing and dependency maps.

3.	epics-versions could allow a directory to be specified and it would show
	EPICS_BASE, and each module dependency it finds assuming that directory is
	the TOP of an epics package by searching $TOP/configure/RELEASE, etc
	Include an option to show which file the macro was found.
	See my bash function, evers(), for a bash equivalent.
	Add a soft link shortcut named evers pointing to epics-versions.

Additional modules needed:
8	hours	ADClCam			both	Rename to ADPgp and move to git. Needs driver release and some svn history stitching.
40	hours	ADClCam			both	Rework needed to add serial commands
6	hours	ether_ip		both	pcds merge still in progress
6	hours	ethercat		both	pcds merge still in progress
2	hours	highlandLVDTV550 both	Simple
2	hours	ip231-asyn		both	Simple, don't import
2	hours	ip330-asyn		both	Simple, don't import
12	hours	ip330			both	Difficult merge
2	hours	laserLocking	both	Simple
2	hours	LeCroy_ENET		both	Simple
30	hours	motor			both	Difficult merge
2	hours	ssi				both	Simple
8	hours	VHSx0x			both	Difficult merge
3	hours	waveProc		both	Collaboration but few local changes

The rest of these modules are only used by one group and most
were created locally, so merges should generally be simple.
A few are from the collaboration so may have some local patches

EPICS related tools not built as extensions
	We still need a way to manage their deployment so we can control
	which versions users get.
